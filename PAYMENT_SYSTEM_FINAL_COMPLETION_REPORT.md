---

## 📋 TASK SUMMARY

1. ✅ **Remove Payment Method Selection** - Eliminated UPI and Bank Transfer options
2. ✅ **Fix Critical Payment Errors** - Resolved "Invoice not found" and "Failed to create order" issues
3. ✅ **Simplify Payment Flow** - Streamlined to Razorpay-only payment system
4. ✅ **Deploy & Test** - Successfully deployed and verified all fixes

---

## 🔧 TECHNICAL FIXES IMPLEMENTED

### **1. Payment Method Selection Removal**
**File:** `app/components/Payment/PaymentGateway.js`
- ❌ Removed: "Choose Payment Method" selection UI
- ❌ Removed: UPI payment form and QR code display  
- ❌ Removed: Bank transfer details section
- ❌ Removed: Payment method state management (`paymentMethod`, `upiId`, `qrCode`)
- ❌ Removed: UPI-related functions (`handleUpiPayment`, `copyUpiId`, `startStatusPolling`)
- ✅ Simplified: Direct Razorpay payment flow only

### **2. Critical Error Resolution**
**Root Cause:** Missing Client model import in payment API  
**Error:** `Schema hasn't been registered for model "Client"`

**Files Fixed:**
- `app/api/payment/create-order/route.js` - Added `import Client from '../../../lib/models/Client.js'`
- `check-invoice-debug.js` - Added Client model import for debugging

**Result:** 500 Internal Server Error → 200 Success Response

### **3. Payment API Verification**
**Before Fix:**
```javascript
❌ Payment initiation error: Error: Failed to create order
❌ HTTP 500 Internal Server Error
```

**After Fix:**
```javascript
✅ Payment API Response:
{
  "success": true,
  "order": {
    "id": "order_QfS8Qhdw3W9V3Q",
    "amount": 101,
    "currency": "INR",
    "status": "created"
  },
  "paymentId": "6848026e8b46f72a875ef3a2",
  "keyId": "rzp_test_3tENk4NwCrtnOC"
}
```
