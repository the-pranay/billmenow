# Admin Dashboard - Complete Implementation & Fixes

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Admin Role Detection Issue
**Problem**: System was treating admin user as normal user and showing regular dashboard instead of admin dashboard.

**Root Cause**: The login API (`/api/auth/login/route.js`) was not returning the `role` field in the user object, so the frontend couldn't detect admin users.

**Fix**: Updated login API to include `role: user.role || 'user'` in the returned user object.

### 2. Dashboard Redirect Logic
**Problem**: Admin users could access the regular dashboard instead of being redirected to admin dashboard.

**Fix**: Added redirect logic in `/app/dashboard/page.js` to automatically redirect admin users to `/admin`.

## New Features Implemented

### 1. Unique Admin Dashboard Design
- **Dark Theme**: Dark gradient background (slate-900 ‚Üí purple-900 ‚Üí slate-900)
- **Admin Branding**: üõ°Ô∏è Admin Control Center header with distinctive styling
- **Real-time Indicator**: Shows live monitoring status with animated pulse
- **Admin Badge**: Special admin role indicator in header

### 2. Enhanced Visual Design

- **Glassmorphism Effect**: Cards use backdrop-blur with transparency
- **Colored Borders**: Different colored borders for different sections
