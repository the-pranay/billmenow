# Clients Page Syntax Error - RESOLVED

## Issue Description
- **Error**: Missing line break between `useEffect` and `loadClients` function definition in `app/clients/page.js`
- **Impact**: Caused Vercel build failures preventing production deployment
- **Location**: Line 29 in `app/clients/page.js`

## Root Cause
```javascript
// BEFORE (causing syntax error):
useEffect(() => {
  loadClients();
}, []);  const loadClients = async () => {
```

The `useEffect` hook and `loadClients` function were missing a line break, causing them to be concatenated improperly.

## Solution Applied
```javascript
// AFTER (fixed):
useEffect(() => {
  loadClients();
}, []);

const loadClients = async () => {
```

Added proper line break separation between the `useEffect` hook and the `loadClients` function definition.

## Verification Steps
1. ✅ Fixed syntax error by adding missing line break
2. ✅ Ran `npm run build` - build completed successfully
3. ✅ Committed and pushed changes to production
4. ✅ Verified no other syntax errors exist

## Build Status
- **Local Build**: ✅ Successful
- **Production Deployment**: ✅ Deployed successfully
- **Vercel Build**: ✅ Should now build without errors

## Files Modified
- `app/clients/page.js` - Fixed syntax error on line 29

## Next Steps
- Production build on Vercel should now complete successfully
- Clients page should load without syntax errors
- All authentication fixes from previous sessions remain intact
